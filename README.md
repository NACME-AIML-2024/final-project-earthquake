## Description
<!--
Could you briefly describe what your project is doing and what tools are used? In addition, you can drop screenshots directly into your README file to add them to your README. Could you take these from your presentations?
-->
This project, led by Professor Chukwuebuka Nweke, focuses on estimating and predicting ground shaking intensity for earthquake engineering. By analyzing microtremor data from a Utah site, it seeks to understand the complex interactions of seismic waves with subsurface geologic features. The project involves identifying both observed and latent features from horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (mHVSR) curves, mapping these features, and developing a regression model to describe the relationship between them and the site-specific seismic responses.
